                                    The SVCE ACM Student Chapter conducted its first event for the AY 2020-21, Abstraction 1.0, on the 29th of August (Saturday). <br /> The registrations for the event began a week ahead, and we received a tremendous amount
                                    of responses, a whopping total of 150 registrations, from the students of all departments. With an incentive of winning an internship with HeyCalibre! and receiving a participation certificate, students enthusiastically
                                    enrolled and took part in the event. <br /> For the first round, the participants had to illustrate a topic, which was given to them a day prior to the event, in simple terms for 3 minutes. <br /> The second round followed
                                    the same pattern as the first round. The 21 participants who progressed to the second round had a shorter preparation time. The top 6 moved on to the final round and each of them had 5 minutes to present pitch decks
                                    of companies such as Uber and Swiggy. <br /> The students were judged on their ability to describe complex topics in simple words, their articulation, confidence, and overall knowledge of given topics. <br /> At the
                                    end of the day, it was a great experience. The participants gained knowledge about various trending industry subjects and technical buzzwords.

                                        design database models with PostgreSQL. This enabled them to further learn the nuance to build REST APIs and were given real time use cases to solve and go about. There was also an elaborate discussion about women

                                    <p>Hackathons are where crazy ideas turn into reality. We hosted our flagship event for this year, a massive hackathon - Yet Another Hackathon! 2K19 or YAH! 2K19 as we like to call it. This is the second edition of the
                                        YAH. YAH!2k18 had around 300 registrations of 100 teams. The second edition of YAH! had over 700 registrants spanning 200 teams across the nation. We shortlisted the top 30 teams based on their submitted abstracts
                                        and their development portfolio (GitHub, LinkedIn etc.). </p>
                                    <p>We had domains ranging from "Healthcare and medicine", "Eco-friendly technology", "Road Safety", "Public Service" and "Finance and technology".</p>
                                    <p>Before commencing the hackathon, we hosted a small icebreaker session to help the participants to network and make new contacts. After all, a hackathon is all about building a community. Besides, all work and no play
                                        make for a very dull Jack. So, we interspersed our hackathon with several amusing activities.</p>
                                    <p>While they were optional, all the participants dived into them to take their mind off things. The Second Edition of our hackathon was hosted at COVE, which resides at the heart of the city, Kotturpuram, Chennai. The
                                        participants were refreshed all day long by our Refreshment Sponsors- Chai Kings, The moose Studio and Sri Mithai. Impressive projects were applause by the mentors and they were hired as interns by our sponsors.
                                        We had the privilege of companies like Mad Street Den, Komparify, Dellner, Manya, Exeter to sponsor our event.</p>
                                    <p>Our judging panel consisted of a hackathon veteran and Director of Accenture Mr Srivatsan Padmanabhan, Mr Parivalan Manoharan from Exeter and Mr Russo Tamilarasan from Wipro. </p>
                                    <p>The overall winners of the hackathon developed an application that redefines offline communication using soundwaves. We had other prizes like the best UI, most feasible project etc. We had a poll among the participants
                                        to select the people's award with a total prize pool of Rs. 50,000. On the whole, YAH! 2k19 was the platform to seek innovative people, new technology, fresh ideas and simply fun.</p>

                                    round consisted of questions over a variety of fields which have been in the news recently. The questions in this round related to everything from AMDs recent Zen Architecture and the uproar behind it to cryptocurrency
                                    millionaires, Boston Dynamics Spot Mini robot and the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. The second round was a logo round with logos that the teams were asked to identify. This round was followed by a Connect
                                    and a debugging round where in the teams were presented with a series of images and were asked to connect them to a specific language, company, technology or person. Overall, there were 40 teams of 2 evenly spread across
                                    the all years. A majority of the participants praised the selection of questions and stated that they acquired new knowledge that they wouldn’t have normally encountered.</p>

                                        questions to be solved in a 1-hour window. From the 250 students who participated, the best 30 rounds were for shortlisted for the final round. This oncampus round received passionate participation from all departments
                                        across all years of study. Participants had 3 hours to solve 40 questions. One of their hurdles was to not just solve any question but to pick intelligently and make the best of their confined time. </p>

                                        at small groups of about 50 at a time to allow for a personal touch and more interaction. Over recurring sessions, we have benefited nearly 400 students with everything from resume advice and acing their interviews

                                    with “Option A” – the choice to sit for placements and/or search independently for jobs as well as with “Option B” – electing to opt for higher studies instead. Instead of having the talk for a wide audience spanning
                                    multiple classrooms, the chapter decided to speak to each class one at a time. This allowed for a more personal session and lead to greater interactivity. This event helped the pre-final year students to gain some clarity

                                    the first round were selected for the second round. The second round was hosted on the hackerrank coding platform and was held on campus. The event had nearly 100 participants in the first round and the second round
                                    had a group of 30 very enthusiastic participants from many departments and belonging to both second year and third year. This event broke the barriers between all the departments and all ages when it comes to coding.</p>

                                <p class="event-desc">In support of women empowerment and having in mind the importance of women representation in STEM fields, ACM SVCE conducted a seminar cum panel discussion, during Women’s week, 2019. The event, “Trio Of Wisdom” showcased
                                    three great orators, who addressed the set of girl students in the second, third and fourth years of CSE and IT Departments.
                                    <br> The first speaker, Ms. Sowmya Mahadevan, COO, Exeter Premedia Services, spoke about the need for women to excel at Technical domains, and stressed on the importance of girls learning to code. She also spoke about
                                    her own experience in the Tech Industry and explained how important it is for young girls to focus on their career. This session was very informative as she was our alma mater’s very own alumni and the students could
                                    connect with her a lot better.The second speaker, Ms. JinaPriya AjithaDoss,an HR Professional, spoke about how women can become more employable and what they need to do in-order to excel in their respective careers.
                                    She gave us an insight on what we need to work on, as undergraduate students, to become potentially skillful candidates. This was truly an eye opening session.The third speaker, Ms. Nandita Pandey, Personal Branding
                                    Coach, shared her life story on how she struggled in the initial phase of her career and how she successfully started a business. Her entrepreneurial story inspired many young women. Following the seminar by the three
                                    speakers, we had a panel discussion where students were able to interact and ask the speakers questions. The panel discussion was held to discuss the struggles faced by girl students and talk about women empowerment
                                    in STEM. The event had an attendance of 100 students and faculty from CSE and IT Departments.The event on the whole was well received by both the students and faculty.</p>

                                    requires a Computer Science Application. This hackathon was conducted in Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering on the 26th and 27th of August, 2017. 8 teams consisting of 2-3 members each took part in this hackathon.
                                    Each team was to make an educational app, based on riboswitches or biobrick assembly within a time period of 24 hours. Finally, each team’s app was judged by Dr. Ravi Kant from Saksin and the team which had made the
                                    best, most efficient app was awarded with a cash prize of Rs.15000. The main aim of this event was to enable the participants to collaborate and learn beyond their specialized course of curriculum. This unique opportunity
                                    enthralled the participating teams more than anything else resulting in a befitting grand success.</p>

                                    event. The main aim of this event was to ensure that students learn to stand up for themselves and for what they believe in because that’s what it takes to succeed in the corporate world. These top notch debates were
                                    well received and appreciated by a sizeable and enthusiastic audience that served as strong encouragement to all the participants. The debate had multiple rounds. The best participants were filtered out and made to
                                    debate against each other in the final round. Joshua Samuel and Chaitra emerged as the winner and the runner up. The outstanding highlight of this event was the depth of research and analysis that participants had done
                                    on their topics - they truly left no stone unturned.</p>

                                    Bootstrap Framework was discussed elaborately since it is one of the most commonly used frameworks for building a responsive website. The workshop also touched upon various other concepts in a more theory oriented way
                                    such as Ajax for asynchronous server requests, hosting/deployment of a website and various other languages currently being used in the industry. A Portfolio Website was prepared to demonstrate the interaction between

                                    between December 4th and 10th. This year, the ACM Student Chapter of SVCE decided to contribute their part to this global initiative by conducting a participatory workshop in Don Bosco School on 4th December 2017. About
                                    40 students from 9th and 10th grades attended the event. An interactive tutorial (from the hourofcode.com) which focuses on the basics of Python, was used to ensure a great learning experience for the students. It had
                                    a chatter bot, named Eliza, explain the basic concepts of Python such as input, print and loop statements. The students then tried their hand at coding with some guidance from the ACM volunteers. The students were more
                                    than just excited with the tutorial sessions and the hands on experience. They participated passionately and gained reasonable expertise on the fundamental concepts of Python. The workshop thereby succeeded in giving
                                    students a head start for their future endeavors. They were actually able to widen their knowledge about coding and thus the essence of Hour of Code was achieved.</p>

                                    is, some information about its mysterious creator and the reasoning behind its creation. He then touched on the most popular cryptocurrencies with brief explanations on each of them. The lecture included demos of the
                                    blockchain ledger system as well as a clear explanation of the hash functions involved and the concept of 'mining'. Tarun also debunked the many myths about blockchain. He then went into an in depth explanation on Merkel
                                    trees and their uses in the blockchain. It ended with an interactive Q&A session with questions involving everything from Mt. Gox to whether they should invest in cryptocurrency.</p>

                                    the format. After a trick question to put the crowd at ease, the quiz began with an energized audience. The first round consisted of questions over a variety of fields which have been in the news recently. The questions
                                    in this round related to everything from Snapchat’s recent design update and the uproar behind it to cryptocurrency millionaires, Boston Dynamics’ Spot Mini robot and the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.
                                    The second round was a logo round with 15 logos that the teams were asked to identify. This round was followed by a “Connect” round wherein the teams were presented with a series of images and were asked to connect
                                    them to a specific language, company, technology or person. The final round was an exciting 20 question round on technology, both new and old. Overall, there were 18 teams of 2 evenly spread across the 2nd and 3rd years.
                                    Ultimately, CoreML consisting of Gurudutt P. and Chran S. of the 3rd year came out as the winner by a narrow margin. The event was a very informational and exciting session for all the participants and they requested
                                    more quizzes to be conducted. A majority of the participants praised the selection of questions and stated that they acquired new knowledge that they wouldn’t have normally encountered.</p>

                                    enthusiasm and excitement. In the end, the team consisting of Adela Florence, Brammi.J and Dhivya.R from 2nd year, CSE-A emerged as the winning team. This was a fun-filled tech event which pushed people to not only
                                    use their tech knowledge, but also their wit and presence of mind.</p>

                                    College of Engineering in order to nurture them to be strong individuals. 10 people participated in this event. The main aim of this event was to ensure that the students learn to analyze any given topic objectively
                                    and holistically because that's what makes them stand out of the crowd and outshine. The debate had multiple rounds. The best participants were filtered out and made to debate against each other in the final round.
                                    Hariharan.B from 1st year, ECE-A and Kaaviya Baskaran from 1st year, IT-A emerged as the winner and the runner up. The unique success factor that came out throughout this debating event was the fact that all participants
                                    focused on positive arguments and rebuttals rather than putting down the competition.</p>

                                    students managing to get the perfect score. Based on a combination of the results of this test, student feedback and discussion with faculty members, a coding development programme was established.</p>

                                <p class="event-desc">A coding development programme was conducted for the 3rd year CS and IT students of the college from February 1st 2018 to March 31st 2018 in association with the placement cell of the college. It consisted of 110 students
                                    who were split into categories based on their mastery of programming. Ample resources in the form of YouTube lectueres, ebooks and interactive tutorials were provided to the students to learn more about topics given
                                    for the week. To aid with their learning, an assignment was given every week as well with questions based on the topic of the week. This way the students were able to both learn and do at the same time. At the end of
                                    the programme, a final test on HackerRank will be conducted with questions based on the topics covered during the programme. Based on the category, topics covered started from conditional statements and went as far
                                    as linked lists and advanced sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick sort.</p>
